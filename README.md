The purpose of this code is to explore an Entity / Event Model, and to try it out on creating simple timeline charts.

It can parse simple natural language statements that involve time, such as

> Socrates was born 470 BC.

> Plato was born 428 BC.

> Aristotle was born 384 BC.

And draw a timeline chart, using HTML.
